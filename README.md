# wilson
Wilson's Algorithm for maze making implemented in Go and intended for use in a 3D Minecraft maze.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Wilson's_algorithm
I have found an implementation in Ruby here: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/20/maze-generation-wilson-s-algorithm

The end goal is to have a command line utility that accepts 3 integer arguments and a file name prefix and outputs a series of PNG files with a diagram of the maze it generated one layer at a time of the size specified by the integer arguments and named sequentially with the prefix specified.
